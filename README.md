# MadLibs

Welcome to MadLibs! Here's how our program works:

1. A function called "madlib" prints out the questions as "inputs"
2. Whenever a user answers a question, their answers are stored as variables (noun1, adjective2, etc.)
3. After the user has "filled in all the blanks", the MadLib prints the user's answers inside of the paragraph

Students looking for an extra challenge should try the following:

1. Create a way for users to replay the game, or choose to quit
2. Add in new madlibs and the program selects one randomly
3. Create a "start menu" where the user selects a madlib based on the "title" of the madlib
